# Commandline Cheatsheets

Everybody likes cheatsheets. If you're like me and use lots of different tools but you can't remember all those cool shortcuts to impress your colleagues.

Sure, there are lots of PDFs out there with everything you need. But are you really gonna have an PDF reader next to your terminal to look up shortcuts? Come on, who are we kidding?

I'm trying to solve that problem by putting the cheatsheets where they belong. The terminal you're working in!

- Cheatsheets directly in your terminal
- Open-Format so you can customize/add/share
- Grep-able!

```bash
user@computer$ cheat -sheet git
```

## Features

 - Local and Remote Cheatsheets in JSON
 - Colored (or coloured) Output
